        <p>This is a classic tale with three characters: Hero, Villain, and Princess.</p>

        <p>The Villain is pitted against both the Hero and the Princess, starting off with one extra pooint. This Villian 
        can choose to add another point to their score against one of these two. If the 
        Villain defeats the Hero, two points are added to their score against the 
        Princess, so this is most often the best choice. If the Villain kills the 
        Hero, they will have two extra points against the princess every round 
        following. If the Villain kills the princess, they will have one extra point 
        against the Hero every round after</p>

        <p>The Princess gets an extra point (although this can be taken by the hero) and 
        defeats the Villain in a tie, but can choose to give up this advantage in order 
        to have their roll add potential points to the hero's roll (1-2: +0 points, 3-4: 
        +1 point, 5-6: +2 points) so that the Villain has a lower chance of beating the 
        Hero and gaining an advantage (+2 pts) against the Princess.</p>

        <p>The Hero can take a point from the Princess for the chance to guess the 
        Villain's roll to automatically win that round. However, the more this 
        is done, the less the Princess will be willing and able to give up her 
        advantage to increase this Hero's roll.</p>

        <p>Characters have 5 Health Points each round. The Hero and Princess lose one HP 
        each time they are defeated by the Villain. The Villain attacks the Hero 
        and Princess each round and loses .5 HP when defeated by either of 
        them. The Villain wins by killing both the Hero and the Princess. The Princess 
        and the Hero can both win by killing the Villain and surviving the game, or 
        one of them can win by killing the Villain after the other has died 
        (although this is more difficult, as you will be playing without the 
        advantage the other gives).</p>
