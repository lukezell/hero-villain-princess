        <p>/* this is a classic tale with three characters: HERO, VILLAIN, and PRINCESS.</p>

        <p>the VILLAIN is pitted against both the HERO and the PRINCESS. the VILLAIN 
        can choose to focus the attack each round on one of these two. One point (+1) 
        will be added to the VILLAIN's score against this player. if the VILLAIN defeats 
        the HERO, there is an added bonus. two points (+2) are added to the VILLAIN's score 
        against the PRINCESS. if the VILLAIN kills the HERO, there will be two extra 
        points (+2) added against the PRINCESS every round after. if the VILLAIN kills the 
        PRINCESS, her extra point is stolen and there will be one extra point (+1) added 
        against the HERO every round after.</p>

        <p>the PRINCESS gets an extra point, although this can be blocked by the HERO, and 
        defeats the VILLAIN in a tie (*), but can choose to give up this advantage in order 
        to for this roll add potential points to the HERO's roll (1-2: +0 points, 3-4: 
        +1 point, 5-6: +2 points) so that the VILLAIN has a lower chance of beating the 
        HERO and gaining an advantage (+2 pts) against the PRINCESS.</p>

        <p>the HERO can block the PRINCESS's extra point for the chance to guess the 
        VILLAIN's roll and automatically win that round. the guess is successful if it is 
        exact or it is one below the villain's roll.</p>

        <p>characters have 5 Health Points each round. the HERO and PRINCESS lose one HP 
        each time they are defeated by the VILLAIN. the VILLAIN attacks the HERO 
        and PRINCESS each round and loses .5 HP when defeated by either of 
        them. the VILLAIN wins by killing both the HERO and the PRINCESS. the PRINCESS 
        and the HERO can both win by killing the VILLAIN and surviving the game, or 
        one of them can win by killing the VILLAIN after the other has died, although 
        this is more difficult, as you will be playing without the advantage the other gives. */</p>
