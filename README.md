This is a classic tale with three teams: Hero, Villain, and Princess.

The Villain is pitted against both the Hero and the Princess. This Villian can choose to add a point to their score against one of these two. If the Villain defeats the Hero, two points are added to their score against the Princess, so this is most often the best choice. If the Villain kills the Hero, they will have an extra two points against the princess every round after.

The Princess defeats the Villain in a tie, but can choose to give up this advantage in order to have their roll add potential points to the hero's roll (1-2: +0 points, 3-4: +1 point, 5-6: +2 points) so that the Villain has a lower chance of beating the Hero and gaining an advantage against the Princess.

The Hero can take a point from the Princess for the chance to guess the Villain's roll too automatically win that round. However, the more this is done, the less the Princess will be willing and able to give up her advantage to increase this Hero's roll.

Characters have 6 lives each round. The Hero and Princess lose one life each time they are defeated by the Villain. The Villain attacks the Hero and Princess each round and loses half a life when defeated by either of them. The Villain wins by killing the Hero and the Princess. The Princess and the Hero can both win by killing the Villain and surviving the game, or one of them can win by killing the Villain after the other has died (although this is more difficult, as you will be playing without the advantage the other gives.)
